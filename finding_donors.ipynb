    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "### Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:** Naive Bayes is used for credit scoring in e-lending platform by predicting default probabilities of borrowers. It is also used in text classification and image classification problems.<sup>[1][2]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- Easy to implement.\n",
    "- Efficient even with big feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:**\n",
    "- Does not perform well in classification problems where phrases are comprised of multiple words.\n",
    "- Due to their simplicity, NB models are often beaten by other properly trained and tuned models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason for being good candidate:** After using one-hot encoding, features in our data increase from 13 to 103. As NB works well with big feature space, this makes NB good candidate for this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:** SVMs are used in face detection, bioinformatics, image classification. They are also widely used to recognize hand-written characters.<sup>[3]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**<sup>[4]</sup>\n",
    "- Ability to model non-linear decision boundaries.\n",
    "- Fairly robust against overfitting, especially in high-dimensional space.\n",
    "- Different kernel functions can be specified for decision function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:**<sup>[4]</sup>\n",
    "- More memory intensive.\n",
    "- Selecting right kernel function can be tricky.\n",
    "- Do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason for being good candidate:** SVMs in scikit-learn support both dense and sparse data. Since we have lot of sparse features after one-hot encoding, SVMs are good choice for this data. Also, they be tuned properly by using kernel trick method to obtain accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:** Decision trees are used in medical field. Medical research and practice have long been important areas of application for decision tree techniques. Recent uses of automatic induction of decision trees can be found in diagnosis, cardiology, psychiatry, to analyze Sudden Infant Death syndrome and for diagnosing thyroid disorders. They are also used in biomedical engineering for identifying features to be used in implantable devices.<sup>[5]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stengths:** <sup>[5][6]</sup>\n",
    "- Simple to understand. Can be visualized.\n",
    "- Requires little data preparation.\n",
    "- Easy to handle missing values without resorting to imputation.\n",
    "- Robust to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:** <sup>[5][6]</sup>\n",
    "- Prone to overfitting and underfitting, especially when a dataset is small.\n",
    "- Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.\n",

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    " - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    "   - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter!"

    "All the three models yield better results as compared to naive predictor that we created earlier. Based on the results, Naive Bayes has lowest accuracy and F score. While evaluating metrics on test set, Decision Tree and SVM are really close. But when we compare metrics of Decision Tree on both training and testing set, we can observe that Decision Tree model tend to overfit  as it deliver better results on training set but do not generalize that good on testing set. Support Vector Machines has most promising and consistent results on both training set and testing set, delivering accuracy around 0.8 and F score around 0.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction time and training time for Naive Bayes and Decision Tree model is almost same, with SVM being slowest both in terms of prediction as well as training time. For both cases of training and prediction, time taken by SVM is greatly influenced by the size of records. With increase in number of records, time taken by SVM to train and predict also increases. Naive Bayes and Decision Tree, however, do not seem to be much affected by size of records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the above factors, and type of the problem at hand, I would suggest to go with Support Vector Machines. As we are interested to find donors for charity, time should not be that much critical, though it is still higher (in seconds) as compared to other two models. Given the time and performance, still Support Vector Machine is good choice for this data."

    "Support Vector Machine(SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for classification and regression problems. Our problem is based on classification so we will describe how SVM is used in classification in simple Layman's terms. SVMs are based on the idea of finding a hyperplane that best separates dataset in distinguishable separate classes. For now, think hyperplane as a line that separates and classifies a set of data, as shown in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![svm1](svm1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image above, gray line that separate blue and green points is called as a hyperplane. Support vectors are the data points nearest to the hyperplane. If these points are removed, position of the hyperlane would change. Hence, support vectors are critical elements of a data set. The further from the hyperplane our data points lie, the more confident we are that they have been correctly classified. We therefore want our data points to be as far away from the hyperplane as possible, while still being on the correct side of it. This distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points(support vectors) is called as margin. The goal is to choose a hyperplane with the greatest possible margin between the hyperplane and any point within the training set, giving a greater chance of new data being classified correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "![svm2](svm2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, data is not as simple as shown in the example. There might be no hyperplane that divides classes in our dataset. As shown in image below, dataset can have blue and green points mixed in such a way that there is no clear hyperlane.\n",
    "\n",
    "![svm3](svm3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In such situations, we use a mathematical method known as 'kernel' to find the hyperplane. Essentially, it is a trick that changes the view of data from 2D to 3D(higher dimension space). This can easliy understood by looking at the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![svm4](svm4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are now in three dimensions, our hyperplane can no longer be a line. It must now be a plane as shown in the example above. The idea is that the data will continue to be mapped into higher and higher dimensions until a hyperplane can be formed to segregate it.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "There is a slight decrease (around 2%) in accuracy of model with reduced feature set. However, f-score is negatively impacted and is decreased by more than 7% which is affecting precision and recall. Form above visualization, we can see that these top 5 features are capturing 60% of information. I would rather inspect other features which are capturing very less information and exclude such features. By performing this step, we can further increase coverage of information and eliminate least significant features thereby reducing training and prediction time and still not compromise that much on performance metrics."
